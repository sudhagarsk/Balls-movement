# Bouncing Ball Animation

This project demonstrates a simple bouncing ball animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The ball moves in a straight line and bounces back when it hits the boundary.

## Features

- **Bouncing Ball**: The ball moves within the boundary and bounces back when it reaches the edge.
- **Animation**: The movement of the ball is continuous and smooth, achieved using JavaScript and the `setInterval()` function.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Basic structure for the webpage.
- **CSS**: Inline styles applied via JavaScript for the ball appearance and positioning.
- **JavaScript**: Controls the movement and boundary detection of the ball.

## How It Works

1. **Ball Creation**: The `hello()` function creates a red circular ball on the screen using the DOM.
2. **Movement**: The `move()` function updates the position of the ball on the screen.
3. **Bouncing Logic**: The ball's velocity reverses direction when it hits the boundary, creating a bouncing effect.

## Installation and Usage
